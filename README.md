What is React?
    React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making code more modular and easier to maintain. React is component-based, meaning the user interface is divided into small, independent parts called components.


What is a React Component?

    A React component is a building block in React applications. Itâ€™s like a function or class that can accept inputs (called "props") and return a part of the UI. Components can be reused across the application, making it easier to build complex user interfaces.
